# From PDB File: Radius of Gyration and Longest Distance

Python script to open a PDB file and find longest distance and radius of gyration for atoms belonging to protein/peptides.

## Usage
If used as a script like:
'python3 rglong.py file.pdb'
it will output commands that can be used in PyMOL to generate a sphere with radius equal to radius of gyration and to have the longest distance indicated.
